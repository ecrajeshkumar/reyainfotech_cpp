/*
*   It is used to convert a pointer of some data type into a pointer of another data type, 
*   even if the data types before and after conversion are different.
*   It does not check if the pointer type and data pointed by the pointer is same or not.
*   It doesnâ€™t have any return type. It simply converts the pointer type.
*   reinterpret_cast is a very special and dangerous type of casting operator. 
*   And is suggested to use it using proper data type i.e., 
*   (pointer data type should be same as original data type).
*   It can typecast any pointer to any other data type.
*   It is used when we want to work with bits.
*   If we use this type of cast then it becomes a non-portable product. 
*   So, it is suggested not to use this concept unless required.
*   It is only used to typecast any pointer to its original type.
*   Boolean value will be converted into integer value i.e., 0 for false and 1 for true.
